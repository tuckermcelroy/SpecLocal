# Repository for "Estimating the spectral density at frequencies near zero"

This repository has several directories:
- code: R functions and scripts needed for simulations and data analyses
- output: text and zip files with simulation output
- data: two data sets used in the paper
- manuscript: 
  
   
  
  

The suggested components are as follows. Directories in the submission may have subdirectories to
further organize the materials.

1.  A `README.md` file - This file gives a short description of the
    paper and an overview of how to carry out the analyses presented in their manuscript.
2.  A `manuscript` directory - This directory will generally hold the source files
    (often LaTeX or Rmd) for the manuscript and any files directly related to the
    generation of the manuscript, including figure files.
3.  A `data` directory - This directory will generally hold the real data files 
    (or facsimile versions of them in place of confidential data) and simulated data files.
    See `data/README.md` for more details. 
4.  A `code` directory - This directory will generally hold 
    source code files that contain the core code to implement the method and various utility/auxiliary functions.
5.  An `output` directory - This directory will generally hold objects derived
    from computations, including results of simulations or real data analyses. See `output/README.md` for more details.
