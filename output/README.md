# Format for output files

There are two types of simulations: (i) an extensive simulation involving four kinds of processes, (ii) a focused simulation of a Gaussian ARMA process with local quadratic, constant, and quartic estimators.

## Extensive simulation

There are 4 zip files containing output files for each type of process.
1. GaussianSims contains output files for Gaussian ARMA processes.
2. LaplaceSims contains output files for Laplace ARMA processes.
3. StudentSims contains output files for Student ARMA processes.
4. NonlinearSims contains output files for order 2 polynomial processes.
